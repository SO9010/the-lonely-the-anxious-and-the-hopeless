    <p1>How do I use this?</p1>
    <br>
    <p3>
      Ok so you're stuck, that is no surprise. You clicked down (as you were told) and you are bombarded with noise and chaos, how are you meant to know what to do?
      First off, make sure you are on a computer, or there will likely be no sound, and it may seem a bit boring and pointless. Ok so now you are 
      using your computer and you have a cursor, and everything is just a bit too loud and chaotic. Try moving your mouse around... Do you get it now?
      The sound is coming from the images. The further you get from one image, the quieter the audio associated with that image becomes. Pretty cool ey?
      <br> <br>
      Ok so now you have done this, it's time for more fun. You can also move about the images, stack them, and then try and unstick them as they cling together
      in an anxiety-enducing manner. <br> <br>
      Also notice as the images enlarge as you click on them.<br> <br>
      Every image is linked, everything is going wrong, and you feel terrified. this is commonly how people feel when they are induced by an anxiety attack.
      Anxiety is something that everyone will feel in their life, but some people suffer from it forever. Imagine that fear, that is what I am trying to point out
      with this online exhibition.

    <p2>Why has this been made?</p2>
    <br>
    <p3>This is a virtual exhibition which contains many different images that I have taken during my A-level photography course. <br> <br>
      The exhibition is chaotic, and overwhelming and conveys feelings of anxiety. Which is my chosen research area. Additionally I chose to
      explore motion and how it is used in photography by many different photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson. <br> <br>
